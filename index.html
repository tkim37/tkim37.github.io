		Mutualism is one of the three main symbiotic relationships. This is when two species interact with each other to gain mutual benefits. An example of this relationship is present between Amphiprioninae (clown fish) and Actiniaria (sea anemone). Sea anemones provide shelters for the clown fish while the clown fish provide the sea anemone with fresh, oxygenated water. Clown fish use sea anemones as shelters from their preys because their predators cannot catch the clown fish once they are in their shelters. Their predators cannot enter these anemones due to their nematocysts. Only fish that could enter sea anemones without being harmed are fish with thick layers of mucus like clown fish - clown fish have mucus layers that are six times thicker than those of ordinary fish.
